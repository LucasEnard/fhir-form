      "codingInstructions": "Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems?\r\n\r\nThe Patient Health Questionnaire is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as \"0\" (not at all) to \"3\" (nearly every day).\r\nFor initial diagnosis:\r\n1. Patient completes PHQ-9 Quick Depression Assessment on accompanying tear-off pad.\r\n2. If there are at least 4 checks in the blue highlighted section (including Questions #1 and #2), consider a depressive disorder. Add score to determine severity.\r\n3a. Consider Major Depressive Disorder: if there are at least 5 checks in the blue highlighted section (one of which corresponds to Question #1 or #2).\r\n3b. Consider Other Depressive Disorder: if there are 2 to 4 checks in the blue highlighted section (one of which corresponds to Question #1 or #2)\r\n\r\nNote: Since the questionnaire relies on patient self-report, all responses should be verified by the clinician and a definitive diagnosis made on clinical grounds, taking into account how well the patient understood the questionnaire, as well as other relevant information from the patient. Diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder or Other Depressive Disorder also require impairment of social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Question #10) and ruling out normal bereavement, a history of a Manic Episode (Bipolar Disorder), and a physical disorder, medication, or other drug as the biological cause of the depressive symptoms.\r\n\r\nTo monitor severity over time for newly diagnosed patients or patients in current treatment for depression:\r\n\r\n1. Patients may complete questionnaires at baseline and at regular intervals (eg, every 2 weeks) at home and bring them in at their next appointment for scoring or they may complete the questionnaire during each scheduled appointment.\r\n2. Add up the checks by column. For every check: Several days = 1 More than half the days = 2 Nearly every day = 3\r\n3. Add together column scores to get a TOTAL score.\r\n4. Refer to the accompanying PHQ-9 Scoring Card to interpret the TOTAL score.\r\n5. Results may be included in patients' files to assist you in setting up a treatment goal, determining degree of response, as well as guiding treatment intervention.\r\n\r\nPHQ-9 is adapted from PRIME MD TODAY, developed by Drs Robert L. Spitzer, Janet B.W. Williams, Kurt Kroenke, and colleagues, with an educational grant from Pfizer Inc. For research information, contact Dr Spitzer at rls8@columbia.edu.",
